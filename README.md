Adept is a platform agnostic dependency management system.

Adept avoids:
- A 'download the Internet' step in your builds that takes forever
- Non-reproducible builds
- Mysteriously corrupt caches
- Complex publish procedures

Adept gives you speed and deterministic behavior:
* Smarter metadata gives exactly what you want or tells you what is wrong
* Separates metadata and artifacts
* Downloads everything in parallel because it can do all resolution up-front
* Uses git and hashes to cache **RELIABLY** and avoid extra http requests
* Publish by just pushing to a git repository
