Adept is a dependency management system for the JVM platform that helps you:
- discover new modules or new versions of existing modules
- publish/add/declare new dependencies
- download dependencies quickly

Adept differs from Ivy and Maven in that it downloads all dependency metadata for all modules in tandem from their respective Git repositories. Leveraging this meta-data, it can **uniquely identify** modules and artifacts.
This makes adept well-suited for discovering dependencies in addition to being predictable and fast.

## Overview

* **Git** stores the versioned meta-data
* **Repositories** contain the meta-data in individual modules
* **Modules** contain the information needed to create the classpath (such as dependencies to other modules, and the locations of artifacts)
* **Build tools**, such as SBT, Gradle (not currently supported), and Ant (not currently supported), use Adept to create their classpath based on a set of modules

**For more information on the current Adept architecture, please see the [Design documentation] [design]**.
